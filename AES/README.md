# AES

* Encryption and decryption of a file using the AES algorithm.
* The hash (with the ability to select an algorithm) from the password entered by the user is used as a key.
* The key is ultimately not saved anywhere.
* You can encrypt the part of the file that is responsible for the data, that is, after encryption, the file remains a valid image and opens correctly.
* You can create a random IV and store in an encrypted file, and the file remains valid.
