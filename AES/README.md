<ul>
  <li>Encryption and decryption of a file using the AES algorithm.</li>
  <li>The hash (with the ability to select an algorithm) from the password entered by the user is used as a key.</li>
  <li>The key is ultimately not saved anywhere.</li>
  <li>You can encrypt the part of the file that is responsible for the data, that is, after encryption, the file remains a valid image and opens correctly.</li>
  <li>You can create a random IV and store in an encrypted file, and the file remains valid.</li>
